<p>
    A Java library for fetching and parsing rekordbox media exports and track analysis files.
</p>

<p>
    The top level package {@link org.deepsymmetry.cratedigger} contains all the classes that are intended for
    direct access by consumers of this library. The other packages contain generated Java code for parsing
    database structures or sending and receiving RPC messages to implement the Mount and NFSv2 protocols used
    to pull databases and analysis files from players.
</p>

<p>
    The class {@link org.deepsymmetry.cratedigger.FileFetcher} is used to actually retrieve the database and
    analysis files as needed, and the class {@link org.deepsymmetry.cratedigger.Database} is used to parse them
    and provide access to the information contained within.

    This project spun out of research performed with <a href="https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery#dysentery"
                                                       target="_blank">dysentery</a>,
