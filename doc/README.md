# Crate Digger Documentation

The main resource here is the [Export Structure Analysis
site](https://djl-analysis.deepsymmetry.org/rekordbox-export-analysis/exports.html).
It is built from the [Antora component](antora.yml) by a [playbook in
the dysentery
project](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery/blob/master/doc/netlify.yml)
with the help of a [build
script](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery/blob/master/doc/build.sh).

Of historical interest only is the older [LaTeX version](Analysis.tex)
of the document.
