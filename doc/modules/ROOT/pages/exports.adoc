.Background
****
The files written to external media by rekordbox for use in player
hardware contain a wealth of information that can be used in place of
queries to the `remotedb` server on the players, which is important
because they can be obtained from the playersâ€™ NFS servers, even if
there are four players in use sharing the same media. Under those
circumstances, `remotedb` queries are impossible. This document shares
what has been learned so far about the files, and how to interpret
them.

== Database Exports

The starting point for finding track metadata from a player is the
database export file, which can be found within rekordbox media at the
following path:

----
/PIONEER/rekordbox/export.pdb
----

(If you are using the
https://deepsymmetry.org/cratedigger/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/cratedigger/FileFetcher.html#fetch(java.net.InetAddress,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.io.File)[Crate
Digger `FileFetcher`] to request this file, use that path as the
`filePath` argument, and use a `mountPath` value of `/B/` if you want
to read it from the SD slot, or `/C/` to obtain it from the USB slot).
