A Java library for parsing rekordbox media exports and track analysis
files.

This project uses the http://kaitai.io[Kaitai Struct] compiler with
the help of a https://github.com/valery1707/kaitai-maven-plugin[Maven
plugin] to create classes that can parse and output binary data
strutures in a convenient and efficient way. It uses them to create
Java classes, because it was created to support
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link[Beat Link], but other
projects can use them to output code for other languages.

== PDB Database

The file `pdb.ksy` contains the structure definitions needed to parse
exported rekordbox databases (`export.pdb` files).

NOTE: Huge thanks to https://github.com/flesniak[Fabian Lesniak] for
figuring out the details of how to interpret these files in his
https://github.com/flesniak/python-prodj-link[python-prodj-link]
project and https://github.com/GreyCat[Mikhail Yakshin] for helping me
quickly learn the more subtle aspects of Kaitai Struct. And this was
all started by a question

https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4311/help-reversing-a-edb-database-file-for-pioneers-rekordbox-software[Stack
Exchange].


=== Exploring the Analysis

One of the amazingly cool things about Kaitai Struct is that you can
use its https://ide.kaitai.io/#[Web IDE] to see how the structure
definitions work and visually explore the contents of files you are
analyzing. This also means you can look inside your own `.pdb` files
and check my work, or get a better understanding of how to use the
generated parsers. To do that, simply upload the `.pdb` file you want
to examine to the Web IDE (it doesn't actually go to the web, it just
gets put in your local browser storage), then also upload my `pdb.ksy`
file, and the Web IDE will parse the exported database, letting you
explore the structures in the tree view, and see the corresponding raw
bytes in the hex viewer.

TIP: You can find the `export.pdb` file on a media stick prepared by
rekordbox inside the `PIONEER` folder, which may be invisible in the
Finder, but you can open it using Terminal commands if you have to. To
download my `pdb.ksy`, click on its link at the top of this page, then
click on the `Raw` button in the header above the first line of the
listing, then tell your browser to save it to disk. Be sure to keep
the `.ksy` extension. Then you can upload it to the Kaitai Struct Web
IDE.


=== Unfinished Tasks

There are still more tables to be figured out. `Columns` looks like
the list of things that can be searched by, so perhaps it will hold
some clues for how to find and use the index tables, which must exist
because it would be horribly slow for the players to do a linear scan
through the main sparse tables whenever they wanted a record.

If we could figure out how to use the indices ourselves, we could
avoid having to load the whole file and index it ourselves.

And, of course there is the track analysis data:

== ANLZ Data

Each track in a rekordbox database also has `ANLZnnnn.DAT` and
`ANLZnnn.EXT` files associated with it, containing the beat grid, an
index allowing rapid seeking to any time in variable-bitrate audio
files, the waveforms, memory cues and loop points.

The structure definitions for these files need to be ported to Kaitai
Struct. This is being worked on in the file `anlz.ksy`.
