## [Unreleased][unreleased]

### Fixed

- Some extended cue entries found in the field were missing the color
  bytes which are expected to follow the comment text, and this was
  causing the parsing of `EXT` files to fail. These values are now
  treated as optional.
- Now builds properly under current JDKs, including Amazon Corretto 11
  (which is a long-term support release). The minimum JDK for building
  is now Java 9, but the resulting build is still compatible back to
  Java 1.6. Building under Java 11 results in much nicer JavaDoc, with
  search support.


## [0.1.1] - 2019-08-25

### Added

- Ability to parse `PCO2` tags, which hold cues and loops along with
  DJ-assigned comment labels and colors, displayable on nxs2 players.
- Ability to parse `PSSI` tags, which hold phrase structure analysis
  performed by rekord box with a Performance license. (As this is not
  currently included when tracks are exported to removable media,
  nor available through a `dbserver` query, it cannot be used by
  Beat Link.) Many thanks to [@mganss](https://github.com/mganss) for
  this contribution!
- More explanation of the interpretation of waveform color preview
  tags.


## 0.1.0 - 2019-02-23
